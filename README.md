# BluePrismGoogleAutomationProcess
Blue Prism process that opens Google chrome browser and searches for a key word. 

I created objects in the objects studio that hold all the different processes needed to work with google. 

First I started in the objects studio. I identified all the different elements that were needed. I needed to spy the elements (teach the robot to look for elements such as buttons and links on the screen.) I first built this project using many actions inside one object but later refactored it and broke it down to many actions that can be reused. I also added wait times between actions to prevent errors from occurring.
